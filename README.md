# AegisDesktop

I created this application to copy the 2FA codes from the computer. No need to open the mobile app.
For now, the app can only load a plain text export from Aegis app.
Nothing is secured / encrypted

ToDo list : 
- Create the Edit / Add view
- Create the Detail view
- Add a way to visualize the notes
- Favorite feature
- Adapt the generate frequency to the entry. (Today is each 30 seconds)
- Adapt the algorithm (Today only TOTP and SHA1. It generate a 6 digit code) 
- Encrypt the local data
- Generate / Use image for each entry (Blue round circle now)
- Import Aegis encrypted export
- Import data from other 2FA app
- Filters / Sort the entries
- ...
